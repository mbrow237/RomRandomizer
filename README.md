Purpose: This is a personal project I made for the thousands of roms I have on my computer. This program will pick a random rom inside a specific directory, and execute the rom. Currently this supports Genesis files(.gen,.32x), Gameboy/Color/Advance(.gba,.gb,.gbc,.mb), Nintendo 64(.v64,.z64), NES(.nes,.unf), SNES(.smc), and GameGear(.gg).

   WARNING
-------------
Inorder for this program to work on your system you must first:
1) Set up each ROM so it will open the appropriate emulator.
2) Change the "path" string in "RecursTest.java" to the directory of your ROM directory
3) Your ROM directory includes at least 1 of the supported file type(seen under purpose).

  TODO LIST
-------------
TOP PRIORITY 
1) Simple GUI with randomize button.
2) Ability to select directory within the program.
3) Support other ROM files.

LOW PRIORITY
1) Improve efficiency and speed.
2) Linux/Mac support.

NOT LIKELY
1) Emulator and Rom association within program.
